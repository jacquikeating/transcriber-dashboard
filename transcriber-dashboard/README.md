# Transcriber Dashboard

Actual name to come later. This app is essentially a collection of all of the tools I've wished for through my 10 years of transcribing college lectures. Target audience will be limited to transcribers for early development, with plans to expand on features for students in version 2.0.

# Planned Core Features

- daily, weekly, and monthly schedules
- contact students, profs, coworkers, supervisors
- annotated recording (add flags while recording audio)
- quickly open email accounts
- barebones user profiles
- live one-offs list
- reminders/to do/checklists
- submit timesheets to invoicing system
- keyboard shortcut lists by subject
- integrate with slides somehow? upload slides file and it automatically generates a heading for each & copies in slide content

# Potential Additional Features

- "supervised" AI text-to-speech w/ live human editing
- student version
- file storage - maybe even use a class schedule format with clickable boxes, and collapsible sections for past semesters
